                            Around the world, children, women, and men are facing enormous obstacles. Poverty, disaster, violent conflict, and the acute impacts of climate change all have been 
                            complicated by the global pandemic. You can join us as we work together with local communities to help build a world where all can prosper.

                            in Afghanistan and Syria, and so much more.
